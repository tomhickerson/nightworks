The steep tunnel~
You enter a series of caves and tunnels leading south into the underdark.
The underdark is very quiet, and from the shine of your light source, you
notice a slight glow to the cavern walls and roof. Almost as if the rock
itself where magical in nature. In the distance you hear the flow of water. You
notice that as you travel further south there is a gentle slope downward. You
can exit the underdark through a door to your north.

Entry to the Underdark...~
The caves and tunnels continue in all directions here. There is a disquieting
feeling here, as if something is about to happen. To the west you hear the
distinct sound of water flowing, from the east you hear the sound of a fire
crackling. To the north and south there is no sound at all.

Tunnels in the underdark~
The caves and tunnels continue east-west here. You feel the pressure of
tons of rock all around you, it is very disquieting. From the west you
hear flowing water, perhaps there is an underground river here.

Caverns deep underground~
The caves and tunnels continue east-west here. Directly to the west there
is the sound of flowing water, and you can here a 'bleep' sound, you cannot
fanthom what could be making it though. The walls here are coated with
persperation, and the air is thick with humidity.

A T-intersection passage~
You come to a T-intersection in the tunnels. Passageways lead east, west
and south. To the west you see a huge cavern opening up to a large mushroom
patch. To the south you see the source of the sound of water flowing, a large
underground river flows into a huge cavern full of underground plant life.
To the east the curving tunnels and caverns continue.

patch~
The patch is several hundred square yard in size, and is made of huge, giant
mushrooms, measuring 6 to 15 feet in height!~
E 
river~
The river is dark and flowing exceptionally fast from one end of the cavern
to the next. It enters and exits the cavern from large slits in the side of
the cavern walls. The river flows across the far end of the cavern, and would
be deadly to enter.~
E
plant life~
The plant life is completely unknown to you, but most seems to be a type of
phosphoresent bush that radiates a pale blue light. All would see to not need
sunlight to survive.~

The River in the Cavern~
This is a huge cavern in the underdark, in which a large river flows through
on the far side. The room is filled with underground plant life, most of which
glow in a soft blue glow, bathing the entire chamber in a soft blue aura. It
is by far the most beautiful sight you have seen so far in this underground
maze of the underdark. As you examine the room closer, you believe it may
be used as an area to raise some sort of cattle type creature, you see signs
of the presence of some type of grazing animal. You can enter the river to
the west, or exit this cavern to the north.

Mushroom Cavern~
You have entered a huge cavern of mushrooms. The mushrooms seem to be
cultivated, for you see a cart-like device and some tools used to cut down
the mushrooms.~

The mushrooms are huge, ranging from 6-15 feet tall. The are a deep dark,
purple colour, and seem to absorb light.~

device~
The device is a cart of some kind, seemingly used to carry off mushroom
bulk to some unknown destination.~

A downward slope...~
The tunnels and caves continue their downward slope in this direction. The
caves and tunnels begin to take on a slight sheen as you traverse this
direction, and you notice tiny spiders moving here and there. You get the
distinct impression that you are heading someplace dangerous.

The sheen on the walls seems to be a strange, sticky substance.~

spider~
The spiders are small and black, and instead of walking to their
destination, seem to spring about like a frog.~

A sticky tunnel~
The tunnels and caves continue east-west here, and to the east there is a
downward slope. The sheen on the walls increases here, and you get the
distinct feeling of danger, as the hairs on your neck rise up.

The slimy tunnel~
The tunnel here is much like it is everywhere else in the underdark, with the
exception of some rope-like webs begin to appear in the southern part of the
tunnel. Your skin begins to prickle as you sense possible danger.

D2 
You see the beginnings of a rather large spiderweb. You believe that whatever
made that web must be pretty large, because it stretches for hundreds of
yards.~
