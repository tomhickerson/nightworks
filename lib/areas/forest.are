monster moat~
The Moat Monster~
The Moat Monster is swimming here.
~
Once a normal man in the employ of the Forest Kingdom, he was sent on a
mission to talk to the High Warlock, who was in self exile.  The warlock,
annoyed at the interruption, transformed the man into the monster you see
before you.  The moat monster returned and lived in the moat of the Forest
Castle, enjoying his new form and the joys of pure nature.  It now keeps the
castle safe from intruders, such as yourself.

inside.  There is a small plaque bolted to the side of the gates.

You have entered a huge and spacious ballroom in Forest Castle.  The
floor has been covered with a polished white marble and the ceiling with a
massive circular mirror.  Foxfire lamps fill the room with silver light,

corner.

The Guards' Quarters~
You have entered a huge hall that serves as the guards' barracks.  A
number of utilitarian cots serve as the beds for the guards of Forest
Castle.  Each cot has a small chest before it, to hold a variety of
possessions.  A medium length mirror is next to the door and a rack to hold
a hundred swords.

The Sixth Floor Intersection~
You have reached the sixth floor.  This room is the intersection of three
wings of Forest Castle.  The north, west, and east wings stretch out,
disappearing to the darkness of each direction.  The south wing, however, is
not here.  During a freak accident playing with magic, the south wing was
lost many years ago.  There is simply space to the south, a couple hundred
foot drop down to the ground.

Falling~
You have stupidly stepped south into mid air.  You plummet a couple
hundred feet, managing to admire the construction of the castle on you way
down, and finally smash into the courtyard beneath you.

You are walking along an ill-kept corridor that leads to the dungeons of
Forest Castle.  Small torches light your path dimly and you can feel rather
than see the cobwebs that brush against your feet at every step.  A thick
layer of dust has accumulated over everything, and you can hear the
squeaking of rats in the distance.

The Dungeon Hallway~
You are walking along the dungeon cells within Forest Castle.  The cells
line the walls to west and east, while the hallway extends from north to
south.  The cells look molding and in bad repair, rusting iron bars and damp
hay stinking up the air.  The dungeon obviously has not been used in quite a
while.

The Dungeon Cell~
You are inside a small cell deep within the dungeon of Forest Castle. 
This cell is filled with damp hay, molding and rancid with slime and dank
water.  The cell is barred from outside with iron bars that seem on the
verge of collapsing from the rust that eat at them from within.  You can
hear the sounds of rats in the hay, burrowing their nests deep.

You have found your way to the lost south wing of Forest Castle.  This
wing was displaced long ago during a freak accident with magic, and has
since been changed, by sorcery.  It no longer follows any sense of structure

has been ripped asunder, showing the stone floor underneath.  In the
distance you can hear the sounds of strange noises, emanating from the
darkness.

The Entrance to the South Tower~
This room used to house the entrance to the South Tower.  However, for
some reason, the south tower has vanished.  Before you is a view from the
south tower, inverted.  The sky is below while the ground is above.  Above
you can see the door to the Treasury, but how to get there is another
question.

Entrance to the Treasury~
You are standing before a door to the treasure.  A small inverted arch
supports you, barely, and while your stomache turns flips at your view of
the world upside down, your footing seems solid.  Perhaps you had better get
out of this place, quickly, before you lose your balance.

weapons and armor, now rusted into uselessness.  A number of torches lie
about, sodden with dampness, and bins of metal equipment have rusted into
complete dust.  A silver scabbard sits against the south wall on a plaque. 
The fabled Curtana, the sword of compulsion, used to be kept here.  It seems
to have been stolen.

The South Wing~
You have found your way to the lost south wing of Forest Castle.  This
wing was displaced long ago during a freak accident with magic, and has
since been changed, by sorcery.  It no longer follows any sense of structure
or order.  The walls are damp and thick with mold and dust while the carpet
has been ripped asunder, showing the stone floor underneath.  In the
distance you can hear the sounds of strange noises, emanating from the
darkness.

The Forest Land~
You are walking along a densely wooded land north of the Forest Castle. 
The woods here are pleasant, the wind cool against your face and the songs
of birds chirping in the wind.  You wonder what could be out here.  You have
heard tales speaking of the Tanglewood somewhere to the north, and beyond
that, the dreaded Darkwood.

The Forest Land~
You are walking along a forest land filled with trees of all kinds.  The
forest itself is light, not being densely populated with vegetation, and
leaves you with a relatively clear view of the sky.  Squirrels chatter
loudly in the trees and birds swoop down to get a quick glance at you.

The Forest Land~
You are exploring the Forest Kingdom which is spread all about you.  It
is easy to see where the Kingdom gets it name, since this entire land is one
massive forest.  The weather here is decent, not being too hot nor too cold
and the traveling is easy.

The Forest Land~
You are surrounded lightly by trees of all types.  You recognized mostly
firs and pines, but catch view of other trees, like rowans, acorns, and even
a few spruce trees.  The wind is cool and refreshing, making you almost want
to set up camp here for the rest of the day.

The Forest Land~
You are in the forest that comprises most of the Forest Kingdom.  The
underbrush of dried leaves and needles crunch under your foot, sending
skitterish animals fleeing at the sounds.  Other animals are not as easy
scared, however, and a bluejay screeches at you from above.
