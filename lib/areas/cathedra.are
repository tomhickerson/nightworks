The Cathedral's Foyer.~
The fantastic gates open, revealing a mythical foyer upon entering the
Cathedral.  The surrounding trees bend to become the walls, and their leaves
become the roof.  An eternal glow shines through the foyor, illuminating the
trees.  Birds fly freely, and the dirt ground is covered by soft beds of
bright green moss.  An intersection to other areas of the Cathedral is to
the east.

The runes etched into the walls form some kind of music which is too complex
to decipher.  It is most likely the Great Music that gave birth to Ea.

banners paintings~
These banners and paintings portray the wonders that were created by Eru and
the Valar.  Included is the creation Ea, Menel, and Arda, the spring of
Arda, and the two lamps, Illuin and Ormal, and their fall.  Battles with
the Black Enemy and the creation of the two trees, Telperion and Laurelin,
also hang from the walls.

The erie glow dims, yet focuses most of its power on two sturdy doors,
the entrance to the Chapel.  The strong doors are decorated with engravings
of each tree found in the surrounding forest.  A dark green dye outlines the
etchings, and dark black beads line each side of the doors.

message~
The Valar Hallway is not for the faint of heart.  Anyone may look upon the
forms of the Valar, but only a hero has any chance of surviving a battle
with one.  This applies to anything else with an amber aura as well!  Also, 
be prepared for other surprises. :>
                                         This is your only warning,
                                         Aalanon your friendly IMP!

lantern in the middle of a dark walnut table.  Set aside from the rest of
the cathedral, the alcove is a small room designated for visitors to put on
ceremonail robes before entering the chapel.  A small rack is set neatly in
a corner with disheveled robes tossed carelessly on hangers.

You are standing at an intersection in the northern hallway, another lies
to the west.  In the middle of a short hallway connecting the two is an
archway leading outside.  A door is to the east and many doors line the
hallway in either direction.  The glare in this section hampers your sight
just like in any other section of the hallway.

This section of the hallway is even brighter than most, probably because
the stained-glass windows to the west let in the light from two enormous
trees, one gold, the other silver.  Obviously some sort of garden lies
within the confines of the cathedral.  The hallway continues off in both
directions, with a bend far to the north and an intersection to the south.

...Melkor, trusting in the strength of his fortress and the might of his
servants, came forth suddenly to war, and struck the first blow, ere the
Valar were prepared; and he assailed the lights of Illuin and Ormal, and
cast down their pillars and broke their lamps.  In the confusion and the
darkness Melkor escaped, though fear fell upon him; for above the roaring
of the seas he heard the voice of Manwe as a mightly wind.

the Valier, the Queens of the Valar, are seven also.  The names of the
Lords in due order are: Manwe, Ulmo, Aule, Orome, Namo, Irmo, and Tulkas;
and the names of the Queens are: Varda, Yavanna, Nienna, Este, Vaire, Vana

The Ki-rin's Room.~
This small room is very plain.  An odd smell, your not sure what it is,
can be sensed in the room, but at the moment it doesn't look like anything
or anyone is in here.  Then you hear an odd sound and feel a small rush of
air over your head.  Hmmmm, something must be here you can't see.

A Private Shrine.~
This room looks like a miniature version of the chapel without the pews. 
An altar sits in the west end of the room, two menara flanking it.  Eru's
symbol is carved into each wall and some kind of script runs around the room
as a border.

script~
This elegant script flows all the way around both halves of the room, and
says...       'And the Valar drew unto them many companions, some less,
some well nigh as great as themselves, and they laboured together in the
ordering of the Earth as powers visible, clad in the raiment of the World,
and were lovely and glorious to see, and blissful, and that the Earth was
becoming as a garden for their delight, for its turmoils were subdued.'

A Private Shrine.~
This end of the room has an altar identical to the one in the chapel, and
two menara, one gold, the other silver, flank it.  Eru's symbol is engraved
upon each wall and that same script, which started in the other half of the
room continues here.

Angelica's Quarters.~
This half of the room is a bedroom and sitting room.  An elegant four
poster bed sits in one corner and a plush, oak chair sits in another. 
Paintings of nature schenes decorate the walls which are covered in curtains
of black satin.  The curtains keep the light from the walls out when
sleeping and can be opened to light the room when awake.

paintings~
Most of the paintings are of forest schenes, but one catches your eye.  This
lone picture is of a young girl standing in a field of corn with an older

This beautiful room is divided into two separate parts, which can be
divided by a black satin curtain.  This half is a dining area, whether
private or public, it seems capable of both, and the other half to the north
is a sleeping area as well as a sitting room.  The symbol of Eru, that of
two suns shining over a mountain are visible throughout both halves.

The Shedu's Room.~
Upon entering, you are assaulted by the smell of horses.  Now normally
that would seem strange, but this time it makes sense.  Within the room you
see a couple of horses, actually horse-shaped individuals, with humanoid
heads.  They turn to you and one says "Can we help you?  Oh!  I'm sorry, we
are of the Shedu race, please don't be frightened."

One lone shedu wearing a diamond-studded headband has a number of other
shedu, all wearing gold headband's, in a semi-circle.  None of them say a
word, but the leader is obviously approving of what the others are doing,
not that anything is being done that you can see.

This room is a little more elaborate than the priest's rooms.  That is
because this is the room of only two bishop's, not a dozen acolyte's.  An
oak table and two chairs sit in one corner, making this the dining area. 
Meanwhile, a single bunkbed and two wardrobes sit to the north.  A few
paintings hang on the walls adding colour to the room.

You are standing beneath the alcove in a secret hallway.  It is very dark
so obviously the walls were not meant to glow down here.  Three guardians
keep you from advancing any further.  They look like winged elves in armor,
and as you enter they say in unison, 'You should not be here, please leave
now or we will be forced to deal with you!  '

This elaborate crypt was obviously excavated for the sole purpose of
holding the remains of some great holy figure of the cathedral.  Religious
icons decorate the room and a large coffin sits in the middle of the room. 
Suddenly a glowing apparition materializes, and you think you might be in
trouble.  Actually you are certain that you are in trouble!
